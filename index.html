        <h3>NISSAN TRUCKS, SUVS AND VANS</h3>
        <p>Proof that an electric vehicle can be affordable, the Nissan Leaf is gasoline-free for under That
          makes the transition from fuel pump to charging station easier to justify, but despite the Leaf's
          inexpensiveness, its drawbacks include a slower 50 kW DC fast-charging maximum capacity and a short 180 miles
          of range on a single charge according to our 75-mph highway test. A shorter range with slower charging is a
          recipe for frustration, but if your travel needs are close and local, the Leaf hatchback makes sense. For more
          driving range for roughly the same price, we'd suggest reading about the Hyundai Kona Electric and Chevrolet
          Bolt and Bolt EUV. Nissan announced its plans to discontinue the Leaf, moving its focus and efforts to its
          more expensive and larger EV, the new Ariya.</p>
